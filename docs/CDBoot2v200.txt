       Short Description: Create a single bootable OS/2 installation CD-ROM
        Long Description: CD Boot/2 is a utility to enhance bootable OS/2 CD-
                          ROMs so that when the CD-ROM is inserted into the
                          drive, a menu is displayed immediately after BIOS
                          has started booting from it. From that menu, the user
                          has to press the spacebar to continue booting from 
                          the removeable media, or if the customizeable period
                          expires, the boot process continues booting from the
                          first harddisk instead. That avoids having to
                          shuffle the 2 CD-ROMs as required by IBM's approach.
                          CD Boot/2 can be used to modify any FAT-based (OS/2,
                          DOS, WIN9x, WIN NT) bootable diskette to display 
                          that menu.
                          Source is included (req. MASM 6.0, IBM VisualAge 
                          C++ V3, Warp Toolkit or compatible).
